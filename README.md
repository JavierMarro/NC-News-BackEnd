Project description:
The goal of this project is to develop an API that allows programmatic access to application data. The project aims to simulate the creation of a real-world backend service that will supply this data to the front-end architecture.

Running the project:
The database used is PostgreSQL and interactions are made using node-postgres. In order to run the project, environment variables must be created. Please create two different .env files, one that links to the test database and another that links to the dev data.

For dependencies that need to be installed please check the package.json dependencies section.

Endpoint articles has been tested to check that articles can be correctly selected by Id. Endpoint has also be tested against a range of possible errors.
